# Challenges about Axios

## Challenge 1

* Create a new Vue project and launch it to see if it already works.
* Now create a new 'users' component.
* Use the API you made in exercise series 3 and retrieve all users via Axios.
You may need to allow CORS in your backend API.
* Ensure that the results are neatly presented in a table.
* Use Vuetify to give the whole a nice layout.

## Challenge 2

* Make sure there is a delete button next to the table with which you can delete that user via Axios.
* First make sure you get a 'are you sure' message before deleting.

## Challenge 3

* Make sure there is an edit button next to the table with which you can request the information of that user via Axios and use it in a form that is in another component.
* When submitting, the info will be adjusted via Axios.
* You don't have to provide input validation.

## Challenge 4

* Add an add button to your users component.
* Now use the same component as in challenge 3 to add a new user.
