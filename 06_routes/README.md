# Challenges about Routes

## Challenge 1

* Create a new Vue project with routes and run it to see if it already works.
* Now create the views 'Home', 'Hardware', 'Software' and 'Networks' .
* Always provide a title, some text and an image. At 'Home' you do this for your study programme, at the others for the elective track.
* Test each view by alternately adding it to your `app.vue`.
* Use Bootstrap to give the whole a nice layout.

## Challenge 2

* Now add the routes to your project and test them by surfing to them via the URL bar.
* Include a 404 page as well.

## Challenge 3

* Now add a website title and navigation bar.
* Now add an extra view `Events` that uses an `EventList.vue` component
* In this component, the data will contain an array of the next 5 events.
* Each Event has a title, a date, a time, a short description and a location.
* Add the necessary information so that you can also visit the events via the navigation bar.
