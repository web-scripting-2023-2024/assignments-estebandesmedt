# Challenges about Vue

## Challenge 1

* Create a new Vue project and launch it to see if it already works.
* Now create a new component `Sports`.
* Provide data that contains 5 different sports consisting of the name and a short description.
* Now make sure that these sports are displayed in a descriptive list on the page.
* Use Bootstrap to give the whole a nice layout.

## Challenge 2

* Now add an image to your web server for each sport.
* Make sure you include this in the data.
* Change your page to a div per sport where the name is used as the title and the description with the image next to it is placed below the title.
* Each sport is also given a background color in the data. You use this to customize the background of your div.
