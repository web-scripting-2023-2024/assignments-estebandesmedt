# Challenges about API calls in Vue

## Challenge 1

* Take a look at the API documentation at https://dust.devbitapp.be/docs/api/
* Create a new Vue project and launch it to see if it already works.
* Now create a new component 'trees'.
* Query the API for all available trees.
* Log the result to the console.
* Make sure the name, description and image are neatly displayed.
* Use Bootstrap to give the whole a nice layout.

## Challenge 2

* Create a new component `treeinfo`.
* Now make sure that you can retrieve the ID of the tree as a search term.
* Now retrieve all sensor information for that tree and visualize it again.

## Challenge 3

* Now add a loading icon.
* Now replace the search term with a selection that you fill with the information of the trees.
